# yolo-cnn
Here is the source code for sample YOLO (You Only Look Once) convolutional neural network (CNN) using Python and the Keras library.

In this example, the YOLO model consists of several convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. The input shape of the model is set to (224, 224, 3) which is a common input size for many image classification tasks. The number of classes is set to 10, but you can modify it based on the number of classes in your dataset.

Make sure you have the Keras library installed (pip install keras) and any other dependencies required by your specific environment.
